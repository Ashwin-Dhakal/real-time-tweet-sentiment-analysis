# real-time-tweet-sentiment-analysis
I completed this full functional live tweet analysis and happy to see the changing graphs. Of course i spent hours pickling all the algorithm.

I found a lot of queries in Sentdex tutorial about " where is the file featuresets.pickle ?" . I was not able to upload this to github, but here is the link for the pickle file at my drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/143r0Z8y69qxvi4sUod21txB3Z9qAegxc/view?usp=sharing

i made a video that shows how the graph changes taking sentiment into analysis:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-iVh-Q0DcM

And here are the screenshots of the analysis:
